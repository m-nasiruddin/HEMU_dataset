Dataset preparation pipeline:
-----------------------------

For text (Wikipedia, BBC, France 24, Euronews, COP'21):
	Text processing:
	1. download Wikipedia pages in HTML (usually it should contain HTML pages with images in a folder)
	2. extract text from HTML by using Justext toolkit (visit their website to learn about Justext and the installation process)
	3. do the unicode (utf8), unicode character, and punctuation normalization of the text
	4. generally text are in paragraphs, convert them into lines (it depends on our requirement)
	5. do tokenization (to identify different items, e.g. words, stop words, etc.)
	6. detect multiword expressions, and named entities
	7. convert the text into XML format (for better processing)
	8. do lemmatization (to reduce the sparcity)
	9. POS-tagging (to understand the semantic value)
	10. sense-tagging (for better understanding of the semantic value of each word in the text)

	Text feature collection:
	1. character count
	2. character position
	3. n-gram, DCToW (Discrete Cosine Transform of Words)

For images (Google Image, Reuter Image):

	Image processing:
	1. collecting image URLs
	2. convert them into HTML format
	3. tag the images (for example, Angela Markel, Donald Trump, etc.)
	
	Image feature collection:
		Intrinsic / word string embedding / unsupervised:
		1. BSM (Blurred Shape Model) [Escalera et al., 2009]
		2. LBP (Local Binary Patterns) [Dey et al., 2016]
		3. SIFT (Scale Invariant Feature Transform) [Lowe, 2004]
		4. HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients)
		5. PHOC (Pyramidal Histogram Of Characters) [Almazan et al., 2014]
		6. SPHOC (Spatial Pyramid Of Characters) []
		7. BoVW (Bag of Visual Words)
		8. POG (Projections of Oriented Gradients)
		9. ZAH (Zoning Aggregating Hypercolumns)

		Extrinsic / handcrafted / supervised:
		1. (like text)

For INA, YouTube:
	Video processing:
	1. download videos
	2. tag the images (for example, Angela Markel, Donald Trump, etc.)
	3. convert them into HTML format
	
	Image feature collection:
		Intrinsic / word string embedding / unsupervised:
		1. (like images)

		Extrinsic / handcrafted / supervised:
		1. (like text)

	Audio processing:
	1. acoustic feature collection (by using HTK toolkit)
	2. convert phonemes into text (by using HTK toolkit)

	Feature collection:
	1. (like text)
